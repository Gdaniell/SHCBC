				<h4>Student Life in the 1920s</h4>
				<p>Women had been allowed to matriculate as members of the University in 1920, but their contact with the male undergraduates remained very restricted.  The College rules stated that ‘students must obtain leave from the Principal or Vice-Principal before accepting invitations for the evening, or for mixed parties’, and several students remembered that they had to be chaperoned if going to tea in a men’s college.  However, one did note that ‘if you had no chaperone you didn’t sign the book, of course’.  The students were not allowed to enter men’s rooms without leave, and had to have what the rules referred to as ‘a companion similarly approved’.  Neither were they permitted to receive men (other than father or brother) in their own rooms.  The restrictions meant that contact with the social life of the University was limited, and so the students concentrated to a great extent on their own clubs and societies.  At this period the College News letter in the St. Hilda's College Chronicle reports the activities of the Debating, Literary and Musical Societies, Poetry and History Clubs and the Social Study Circle.  College dances were held, and rowing was strongly supported; in 1927 it was reported that ‘St. Hilda's has distinguished itself recently in rowing, there being five Hall representatives in the boat that defeated Cambridge.’
